# mikeMeyers
A custom Roblox World

Here is the link to the game on ROBLOX. This game was created using Roblox Studio.

This world is based off of a popular custom game in Call of Duty. The premise is based off of the character Michael Myers from the movie Halloween.
One person starts off as Mike Meyers, and the other players hide. Mike Meyers tries to find them and kill them, and all they can do is run.
When there is one player left, they can fight back, and they duel. The winner gets to be Mike Meyers.

The game, as it is now, is not ready to be released on it's own. The map is of my own design, and the players have the options to switch teams and players who are 
not on the Mike Meyers team can spectate. So as of right now, it's meant to be played with friends. The map has many hiding places and unique structures which 
help the prey hide more effectively. I had a few friends play test, and there are a few bugs that need to be fixed.

Bugs:

* When players first spawn in, they can't spectate. They need to respawn to spectate.

* Mike Meyers should be faster than the other players. That script doesn't seem to be working properly, or the speed adavantage is not enough to be noticeable.


Again, this is a game for friends to play. But, if the game were to be released to be played by a wider base of people, here are some additions that I could add

* Loading Screen

* A delegate which chooses a random Mike Meyers to begin with and automatically assigns teams (to prevent trolls)

* Multiple maps and a voting process to choose the map each round.
